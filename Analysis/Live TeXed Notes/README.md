I plan to live-TeX the class notes of Analysis 4 during this semester, subject to its usefulness and my availability. I shall upload them here if it is of use to anyone. I should however warn you that these notes may not be rigorous, complete or exact although I've attempted to make them 'precisely' an account of the class proceedings. Neither are these notes checked for errors, typographical or mathematical. Hence, you are advised to use them at your own peril. That said, I'm willing to maintain these notes, i.e. by fixing errors as and when they're pointed out and updating at the repository. Hence, please let me know if errors, of any kind whatsoever, are found.

The final parts of Lecture 02 are incomplete. Those will be resolved and the file shall (possibly) be uploaded by 30 Jan, 2022.
